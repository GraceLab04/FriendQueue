# FriendQueue

A C++ project that implements a queue to manage a "friends list." This project demonstrates core concepts of object-oriented programming and data structure design.

---

## Features
- A templated `Queue` class for managing friends.
- Functionalities include:
  - **Add a Friend**: Add a friend to the queue.
  - **Remove a Friend**: Remove the first friend from the queue.
  - **Reset the Friend List**: Clear the queue.
  - **View Friends**: Print the list of friends (both in order and reverse).
  - **View the First Friend**: Peek at the first friend without removing them.
  - **Check if Empty**: Verify if the queue is empty.
- Real-world demonstration: Parses a text file of U.S. Presidents and their states to simulate friend data.

## How to Use
1. Compile the project using **CMake**.
2. Ensure you have a valid input file (`presidentsWstates.txt`) formatted as `Name State` (e.g., `George Washington VA`).
3. Run the executable to see the program in action.
4. Interact with the friend list through the provided menu in the `main.cpp` program.

---

### Example Commands:
1. Add friends to the list from a file.
2. View all friends.
3. Remove a friend.
4. Reset the friend list and verify it is empty.
